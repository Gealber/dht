## TODO

This todo list will increase and decrease according to the progress. Don't take as definetely list of what to implement.

- [DONE] Scheleton of project
    - [DONE] Parse all allowed query method(PING, FIND_NODE, FIND_VALUE, STORE). To re-check later.
- [PROGRESS] Write TL parser and serializer in Golang.
    - [DONE] Simple case of TL serializer, serializing structs with built-in types
    - [DONE] Serialize structs with complex types
    - [DONE] Parse data byte into struct with simple built-in types
    - [DONE] Parse data bytes into struct with complex types.
    - [DONE] Serialize flags on TL definition
    - [DONE] Handle 'vector' TL type for serialization
    - [IN-PROGRESS] Handle 'vector' and flags cases for parsing(On hold untils will be needed)
    - Improve TL structure tests, some of the tests cases are not generic enough
    - Refactor both serializer and parser, methods are too long
- ADNL
    - [DONE] Make ADNL on UDP example works. There's something that I'm missing here.
        - [DONE] Integrate xssnick/tonutils-go/adnl for the example in the meanwhile.
    - Implement ADNL or integrate existing implementation from tonutils-go
        - [DONE] Write first an internal documentation about how ADNL works. Taking ton blockchain code as reference.
        - [IN-PROGRESS] Read ADNL implementation in ton blockchain, yeah I don't understand C++
        - [IN-PROGRESS] Start implementing the protocol.
            - [DONE] Perform checksum validation on messages OUTSIDE channel 
            - [] Perform checksum validation on messages IN channel 
    - [DONE] Implement AES-CTR cipher
    - Handle responses from adnl requests. Current implementation is assuming adnl is async.
- DHT methods
    - [DONE] Implement availability mechanism when a PONG is received. Needs to make sure buckets are sorted.
        - [DONE] Make sure that routing table buckets are sorted after each update of delays tracker
        - [DONE] Place mutex to avoid race conditions
    - Implement STORE
    - Implement FIND_NODE
    - Implement FIND_VALUE
- Remove references to tonutils-go implementations
- Integrate key-value storage, just use interface and later on decide which key-value to use.
- Implement clean up process in node when with a shutdown signal
- Write during the process unit tests for all components
- Check which models should be TL boxed
- Update README file with extensive description
